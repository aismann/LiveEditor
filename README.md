# The world's first(*) "Live" :: Editor     

The big new feature is:
“Live::Editor” ```works together with you on your *running*``` Axmol game!

The interaction with your game is permanent and you be at the same time:

- Artist
- Player
- Designer (Game-/Level-/UI)
- Developer

Realising games in minutes will be possible.

## In a word:

You be the **Winner** using “Live::Editor” writing your next game!

For what standing the **::** ?

Thats the place holder for something like: 

- :Scene:
- :Sprite:
- :PhysicsSprite:
- :etc:
  
So it can also called: 

- LiveSceneEditor
- LiveSpriteEditor
- LivePhysicsSpriteEditor
- etc

(*) as far as I'm know ;)
